# Data Processing, Visualisation and Reporting using R

RStudio project and supporting files for a quick start of the workshop.

## Required software

1. R, preferably in the most recent version

    - Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
    - Mac OS: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
    - Linux: Use your system's package manager, or https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

2. RStudio, preferably in the most recent version

    https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

3. R packages. Copy the following code at once into RStudio's "Console" pane and press "Enter".

    ```r
    install.packages(c(
      "tidyverse", "nycflights13", "shiny", "here", "xaringan", "rticles", "conflicted"
    ))
    ```

## Alternative: Cloud instance

If you can't install RStudio on your local machine, or experience problems, you can always use the rstudio.cloud instance.

1. Navigate to https://rstudio.cloud/project/271256. (Please use a modern browser, Firefox or Chrome should work reasonably well.)

    This requires signing up, you can also sign in with a GitHub or Google account.

2. After signing in, there will be a button "Save a Permanent Copy" on the toolbar (between the red TEMPORARY sign and the gear). Click it to make sure your changes aren't lost.
